# What is Prompt Chaining?

Imagine you’re teaching a robot (like ChatGPT) to help you solve a problem, but the problem is too big to handle all at once. Instead of asking the robot one big question, you break it into smaller, simplers. Each builds on the one before it, like a chain.

### How Does Prompt Chaining Work?

1. **Start with a small question:** You ask the robot an easy question or give it some simple instructions. For example, “List some healthy meal ideas.”

2. **Use the answer to ask the next question:** Once the robot answers, you use that answer to guide the next. For example, “From this list, suggest meals that are quick to make.”

3. **Repeat until you reach the goal:** You keep going by until you solve the big problem.

### Example of Prompt Chaining

Let’s say you want to plan a weekend trip. Here's how you might use prompt chaining:

1. **First prompt:** "Suggest some fun weekend activities for families."

   - The robot lists ideas like visiting a park, going to a museum, or having a picnic.

2. **Second prompt:** "Which of these activities are free?"

   - The robot filters the list to show free activities.

3. **Third prompt:** "Create a schedule for the weekend using these free activities."
   - The robot creates a detailed plan for the weekend.

### Why is Prompt Chaining Useful?

- **Breaks complexity into smalls:** Instead of overwhelming the robot with a big question, you guide it by.
- **Better answers:** Each builds context, so the robot gives more accurate and useful responses.
- **Customizable:** You can adjust the next based on what you need.

In simple terms, prompt chaining is like giving instructions to a friend one at a time, so they don’t get confused and can help you better.
